# SPA + API + Auth0

The objective is provide an example about how to use a solution provided by a SPA Page (constructed with AngularJS) + REST API (using Node.js). For the entire process of authentication and authorization, we'll use [Auth0](https://auth0.com), that provides these features as services. The origem of data isn't the fundamental thing here, so we focused in authentication, authorization and features related to controlling of rules.

After cloning the solution, run these steps:

1ยบ Go to directory API, open a command prompt and run the command (start de API):

```sh
node server or

nodemon server

as you wish ;p
```

2ยบ Go to directory SPA, open a new command prompt and run the command (start de SPA):

```sh
node index or

nodemon index

as you wish ;p
```

3ยบ Open the address http://localhost:3000/ in the browser and enjoy the ride!
