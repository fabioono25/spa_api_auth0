# SPA + API + Auth0

The objective is provide an example about how to use a solution provided by a SPA Page (constructed with AngularJS) + REST API (using Node.js). For the entire process of authentication and authorization, we'll use [Auth0](https://auth0.com), that provides these features as services.

After cloning the solution, run these steps:

1ยบ Go to directory API, open a command prompt and run the command (start de API):

```sh
node server or

nodemon server

as you wish ;p
```

2ยบ Go to directory SPA, open a new command prompt and run the command (start de SPA):

```sh
node index or

nodemon index

as you wish ;p
```

3ยบ Open the address http://localhost:3000/ in the browser and enjoy the ride!
